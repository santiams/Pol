# Pol

[![.NET](https://github.com/santiams/Pol/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/santiams/Pol/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

Pol is so called because it's Polly with bits missing.

It's an opinionated take on Polly in that it deals with only a subset of Polly's excellent resilience strategies.

It's also a Work In Progress so please bear with me
